<h1>DonorPop</h1>

This is a site I'm creating to facilitate donation and donor tracking for political campaigns. It's being written with Python's Flask microframework and Bootstrap.

You will need to make changes in donorpop/config.py for your system, have Python 2.7 or higher and MySQL installed to get up and running.
